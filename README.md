# Essium's Xenqu Platform API

This repo holds supporting images and files for configuring a Postman environment and globals so you can begin testing.

View the docs at https://apidocs.xenqu.com/

To use the API you'll need:

* Client ID and Secret
* Public/Private 2048-bit RSA keypair in PEM format
* A Xenqu subscriber account you want to access

You provide the cert (we need the public key, you keep the private key safe) and we provide the rest.
